Normally these are <Major.Minor.Revision.Build>.

Where:

    Major is a major update to the software
    Minor is a small update to the software
    Revision is any change made (bug fixes, small updates)
    Build number (normally an auto increment if used)

In your example (1.7.1.0):

    Major version 1
    Had 7 minor updates
    First revision/bugfix
    No build number
